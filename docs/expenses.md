# Expenses and Reimbursement

All expenses must be approved **before** the event. Expenses not approved before spending will not be reimbursed.

## What can be reimbursed?

Open Source Community Africa will reimburse a Chapter Lead for approved costs associated with a relevant activity. This could include:

- Small costs of running an event (e.g., light refreshment or logistics)
- Reuseable materials for multiple events (e.g., a roll-up banner)

## Getting approval for a reimbursement

Before your expense is approved, an estimate must be approved. However, this estimate does not have to be exact but should be a good approximation of the cost. 

Once you have worked out an estimate of the cost, include it in your issue. OSCA's Finance and Community Manager will then comment to approve or ask further questions.

## Reimbursement note

It's important to remember that, like all resources, the budget available for reimbursements is limited, you should therefore do your best to use it responsibly. Please help us help you by spending responsibly.

## Once your expense has been approved

Once your expense has been approved, you can make the purchase. Keep receipts for all purchases, as you will need them to follow the steps in the next section.
